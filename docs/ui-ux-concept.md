# UI/UX Concept — tinytinkerer

This document records the design intent behind the current UI so future agents can extend it consistently.

## Style direction

The palette is warm stone and amber: `--bg` (#f6f2ec), `--panel` (#fffaf5), `--border` (#dccdb9), `--muted` (#766a5d), amber-400/500 for interactive focus and accent. The overall effect is editorial and calm, not saturated or high-contrast. Avoid introducing blues, purples, or vivid accent colours that would break this tone.

Typography uses Inter at default weights. Headings inside panels are `text-xs font-medium uppercase tracking-wider text-[var(--muted)]` — small, quiet labels that orient without dominating. Never use large headings or hero text on the main page.

Borders and shadows are used sparingly to indicate hierarchy:
- Primary panel (conversation): `shadow-sm` + `border border-[var(--border)]` + `bg-[var(--panel)]`
- Secondary panels (thinking, tools): no shadow + `bg-[var(--bg)]` + lighter border
- Composer: `shadow-sm` + `bg-[var(--panel)]`, visually paired with the conversation panel

## Layout

The page is a single full-height column (`h-screen`, `overflow-hidden`, `max-w-5xl mx-auto`). Sections stack vertically inside a `<main>` with a small gap (`gap-3`). There is no sticky top bar or global nav — the settings gear lives inside the composer so controls stay close to where they are used.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Conversation (flex-1, scrollable)   │
├──────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Thinking timeline (conditional)     │  ← secondary, lighter
├──────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Tool activity    (conditional)      │  ← secondary, lighter
├──────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Composer (textarea + actions)       │
└──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The conversation panel takes `flex-1` and all available height. Secondary panels are fixed-height and shrink to fit their content. When both secondary panels are disabled in settings the page is just conversation + composer, which is the baseline clean state.

## Conversation panel

The dominant surface. White-ish background (`--panel`), shadow, generous padding. User messages render as warm amber-tinted bubbles. Assistant messages render on a white card. Error and system messages use colour-coded borders (rose, amber, stone). Streaming uses a blinking amber cursor.

Do not add sidebars, split panes, or competing surfaces at the same visual weight as the conversation.

## Composer

Sits at the bottom of the column. Contains a growing textarea and an action row:
- **Left**: settings gear (tertiary, icon-only)
- **Right**: Reset (secondary, labelled button), Cancel retry (secondary, conditional), Send (primary CTA, min-w-24)

Action hierarchy: Send is the single primary action. Reset and Cancel are secondary. Settings is tertiary. Never place a primary CTA next to another primary CTA.

## Settings modal

Settings live in a Radix Dialog, opened via the settings gear. This keeps the main page uncluttered and lets settings feel like a deliberate mode change. The modal is `max-w-md`, centred, with a header / scrollable body layout.

Inside the modal, sections are separated by `<hr>` dividers with `SectionHeading` labels (`text-xs uppercase tracking-wider`). Each section has a single responsibility (Auth, Models, Search, Interface). Toggle rows use the `ToggleRow` primitive with a custom amber toggle control.

Do not put settings inline on the main page. Do not add floating panels or drawer overlays for settings.

## Secondary panels (Thinking / Tools)

Thinking timeline and Tool activity are opt-in transparency features, not primary content. They must always feel subordinate:

- Use `bg-[var(--bg)]` (not `--panel`) so they sit one step behind the conversation.
- No `shadow-sm` — shadows are reserved for primary panels.
- Reduced padding (`px-4 py-3` vs `p-5` for the conversation).
- Headings at `text-xs font-medium` — quieter than primary panel headings.
- Timeline entries: compact rows with a small step-number badge, no card borders.
- Tool activity entries: `text-xs`, muted colours, `<details>` for expandable output.

Both panels are conditionally rendered based on their persisted toggle in settings (`showThinkingTimeline`, `showToolActivity`). When disabled, the section is completely removed from the DOM — no empty placeholder, no skeleton.

## Adding new UI

Follow these rules when introducing new elements:

1. **Every new control needs a home**: composer action row for send-adjacent actions, settings modal for preferences, inline inline inline for contextual actions inside a message.
2. **Match the visual tier**: primary surfaces get `--panel` + shadow; secondary surfaces get `--bg`, no shadow.
3. **Keep the palette warm**: amber for interactive focus/accent, stone for text, no cold blues.
4. **No orphan panels**: don't add a new panel on the main page without gating it behind a settings toggle and making it visually secondary.
5. **Mobile first**: the layout is a single column. New sections must stack cleanly without horizontal overflow on narrow screens.
