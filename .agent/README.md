# `.agent` — WAT skills (Workflow · Agent · Tools)

Skills the agent uses to work in this repo. Core idea: **offload deterministic steps to scripts so you stay focused on decisions.** Chained 90%-accurate manual steps decay fast (0.9^5 ≈ 59%) — scripts don't drift, and they save tokens.

## Skill layout

```
.agent/skills/<skill-name>/
  SKILL.md      # when to use, how, available tools, constraints, success criteria
  workflows/    # OPTIONAL: markdown SOPs (some skills are just SKILL.md + tools/)
  tools/        # deterministic scripts SKILL.md / the workflows call
```

## How you (the agent) work

1. Match the task to a skill, read its `SKILL.md`.
2. If it has `workflows/`, scan their **filenames** for a relevant SOP — don't read every file.
3. Follow `SKILL.md` (and the SOP, if any); run the tool scripts instead of doing the steps by hand.
4. **Self-evolve:** if you solved something repeatable the hard way, capture it as a new workflow SOP (+ tool). Future agents thank you.
