# `.agent` — WAT skills (Workflow · Agent · Tools)

Skills the agent uses to work in this repo. Core idea: **offload deterministic steps to scripts so you stay focused on decisions.** Chained 90%-accurate manual steps decay fast (0.9^5 ≈ 59%) — scripts don't drift, and they save tokens.

## Skill layout

```
.agent/skills/<skill-name>/
  SKILL.md      # when to use, how, available tools, constraints, success criteria
  workflows/    # markdown SOPs (step-by-step procedures)
  tools/        # deterministic scripts the workflows call
```

## How you (the agent) work

1. Match the task to a skill, read its `SKILL.md`.
2. Scan workflow **filenames** for a relevant SOP — don't read every file.
3. Follow the SOP; run the tool scripts instead of doing the steps by hand.
4. **Self-evolve:** if you solved something repeatable the hard way, capture it as a new workflow SOP (+ tool). Future agents thank you.

## Add a skill

```
node .agent/skills/create-skill/tools/create-skill.mjs <name>
```

Scaffolds the structure above, then fill in `SKILL.md`. See `create-skill/`.
